# Events

ChurchCRM allows you to create events which will appear in your church calendar.

Events can be recurring (such as a weekly church service) or unique (such as a community outreach day).

Once an event is created, you can:

* Take attendance for your event and review attendance metrics
* Manage child care security by checking children in and out of classrooms
* View event history and statistics

> **Tip:** Events appear on your church calendar and can be set to recur automatically.

## Events Dashboard

The **Events** top-level menu opens a dedicated **Events Dashboard** that gives you an at-a-glance view of everything event-related:

- **Summary stats** — upcoming events, total events this month/quarter, and attendance totals
- **Upcoming events list** — the next scheduled events with one-click access to edit or take attendance
- **Event types** — quick access to add/edit event types
- **Quick actions** — add a new event, add an event type, or jump to attendance reports

From the dashboard you can click any event to open its detail page, record attendance, or start child check-in/check-out. The dashboard replaces the older flat "list of events" page and is the recommended starting point for all event workflows.

:::tip Calendar vs. Events Dashboard
The **Calendar** (in the top navigation) shows events in a month/week view with an offcanvas editor — great for scheduling. The **Events Dashboard** is focused on attendance, metrics, and event management. Both read from the same underlying event data.
:::

### Filtering the Dashboard

Three filter dropdowns appear at the top of the Events Dashboard:

| Filter | Options | Default |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Any event type defined in your system | All Types |
| **Month** | All Months, January – December | All Months |
| **Year** | Years that have events | Current year |

**Month filter** — Select a specific month to narrow the dashboard to events that fall in that month within the chosen year. Selecting **All Months** (the default) restores the full-year view with no change in behaviour.

**Direct linking to a specific month** — Append the `?month=N` query parameter to the dashboard URL (where `N` is `1` for January through `12` for December) to open the dashboard pre-filtered to that month:

```
/crm/event/dashboard?month=3        ← March of the current year
/crm/event/dashboard?month=12       ← December of the current year
```

You can combine parameters to link directly to a specific month *and* year:

```
/crm/event/dashboard?month=6&year=2025   ← June 2025
```

**Clear Filter link** — A **Clear Filter** link appears in the filter bar whenever a Type or Month filter is active. Clicking it resets both dropdowns to their "All" defaults while keeping the current Year selection. The link does *not* appear when only the Year is changed.

:::note Auto-scroll behaviour
By default the dashboard auto-scrolls to the current month's section. When a Month filter is active, auto-scroll is suppressed so the filtered view stays at the top of the page.
:::

### Past Events (collapsed sections)

Past and inactive events are grouped into collapsible **month sections** below the active events list. This keeps the dashboard focused on upcoming events without losing access to history.

**What counts as a past event:**
- The event's end date/time is earlier than now, **or**
- The event has been manually deactivated (marked inactive)

**How to use past events:**
- Each month with past events shows a collapsed card header (e.g. *"July 2026 — 4 events"*).
- Click the header to expand that month and see the events inside.
- Your expanded/collapsed state is remembered per browser — refreshing the page keeps the same sections open.
- If a month contains *only* past events (no upcoming events fall in that month), its section expands automatically so the events are visible without an extra click.

## Step-by-step: Recording Attendance

1. **Create an event type** (if needed): **Events** → **Admin** → **Event Types** → **Add Event Type**.
2. **Create an event**: **Events** → **Add Church Event** — choose type, date, time, and save.
3. **Add people to the Cart**: Search or browse people, click **Add to Cart**.
4. **Record attendance**: **Cart** → **Empty Cart to Event** → select the event → **Add Cart to Event**.

Attendance is saved automatically. Use **Data/Reports** → **Event Attendance Reports** to view attendance history.

---

## Creating an Event Type

Event types behave like templates which define the parameters for events you will create in the future. Event types allow you to set details such as the recurrence frequency and the default start time an event can have.

You can also create free-form text fields allowing you to identify the type of individuals you would like to count for the purpose of attendance. These fields are arbitrary, carry no inherent meaning, and possess no relationship with the ChurchCRM database itself.

To create an event type:

1. Go to **Events** → **Admin** → **Event Types**.
2. Click **Add Event Type**.
3. Make your entries and choose *Save Changes*.

### Example

You want to create an event type to support the "Newcomers' Lunch" you host once in a while at your church. The lunch doesn't take place on a regular basis, and you want to be able to see the number of regular churchgoers (whether they are members or not) as well as newcomers who attended this lunch.

To do this, you will add a new event type and make the following settings:

* **Event Type Name**: Newcomers' Lunch
* **Recurrence Pattern**: None
* **Default Start Time**: 12:30PM
* **Attendance Counts**: Regular Churchgoers, Newcomers

## Creating an Event

Events inherit some properties from event types. You can additionally define the event title, description, date range, event sermon (if any), and status.

To create an event:

1. Choose *Events -> Add Church Event*.
2. Select an event type.
3. Make your entries and choose *Save Changes*.

## Taking Attendance for an Event

Throughout the course of an event, you can take attendance to track the participation across various people classifications, such as members, regular attenders, visitors, and so on.

To add an existing person to an event:

1. Go to **People** → **Person Listing**.
2. In the **Filter and Cart** area, enter a name in the search field and choose *Apply Filter*.
3. In the **Listing** area, choose the *Add to Cart* icon.
4. Continue adding people to the cart as described in the previous steps.
5. Choose the shopping cart icon in the header bar at the top of the screen.
6. Choose *Empty Cart to Event*.
7. Select your event and choose *Add Cart to Event*.

To add a visitor to an event:

1. Go to **People** → **Add New Person**.
2. Make your entries, ensuring you set the **Classification** field to *Guest*.
3. Choose *Save*.
4. Choose *Add to Cart*.
5. Choose the shopping cart icon in the header bar at the top of the screen.
6. Choose *Empty Cart to Event*.
7. Select your event and choose *Add Cart to Event*.

## Generating Attendance Reports for an Event

You can generate reports based on attendance history for an event. The tracked person types measured are defined in the event type.

To generate a report:

1. Go to **Data/Reports** (direct link in the navigation).
2. Choose an event type from the *Event Attendance Reports* area.
3. Choose a person type corresponding to the event for which you wish to generate a report.

## Unified Event Editor

The **event editor is consistent across all entry points** — Calendar offcanvas, Events Dashboard, and full event detail page all show the same form. All times are saved in the local wall-clock time of the church, eliminating daylight-saving edge cases.

## Timeline Filters & Breadcrumbs

Event roster pages show **member photos** on each attendee row, with improved badge contrast. **Breadcrumb navigation** (`Events → [Event Name] → Attendance`) lets you jump back up the hierarchy without the browser back button.

## Checking Children In and Out of an Event

During any event, you can monitor the checking in and checking out of children to comply with your church child protection policy.

:::tip Use Kiosk Check-in for hands-free operation
For continuous self-service check-in at a station, see [Kiosk Devices](/user-guide/kiosk-devices). The kiosk now works with **any group type** — not just Sunday School.
:::

In this scenario, you use the `PersonID` number associated with an individual to identify them in the system. This `PersonID` number is recognizable in the URL of the individual’s record in the system.

To check a child into an event:

1. Choose *Events -> Check-in and Check-out*.
2. Select an event.
3. Enter the `PersonID` of the child in the left-hand field and the `PersonID` of the parent or guardian in the right-hand field. Note that you can use the **Person Listing** (**People** → **Person Listing**) to look up and determine the `PersonID` of any individual.
4. Choose *Verify*.
5. Review the data and choose *CheckIn*.

To check a child out of an event:

1. Choose *Events -> Check-in and Check-out*.
2. Select an event.
3. Locate the entry of a child who had previously been checked into the system and choose *Checkout*.
4. Enter the `PersonID` of the parent or guardian in the right-hand field. Note that you can use the **Person Listing** (**People** → **Person Listing**) to look up and determine the `PersonID` of any individual.
5. Choose *Verify CheckOut*.
6. Review the data and choose *Finalize CheckOut*.
