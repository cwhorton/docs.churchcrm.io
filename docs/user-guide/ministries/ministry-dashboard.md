# The Ministry Dashboard

**Ministries → Dashboard** (`/ministries/dashboard`) is the coordinator's daily screen: *"what needs your attention this week"*. Everything on it is one click from the action that fixes it.

## What it shows

Top to bottom, in the order that matters:

1. **Needs filling** — every position still short in the window, with the date, ministry and team, a red badge such as *"Needs 2 more"* (its tooltip gives the numbers, for example *"0 of 2–3"*) and a **Fill** button that opens the [staffing view](./staffing-an-occurrence.md) on that date. The red count in the card header is the total number of people still needed. When nothing is short the card says *"Nothing is short — every position in this window has the people it needs."*
2. **Waiting for a reply** — assignments still **Pending**, each with the person, position, date, ministry and team. A yellow **Due soon** badge marks those inside the reminder lead time. The row menu offers **Open the occurrence**, where you can record their answer, send the message again or cancel the assignment, and **View person**.
3. **Substitution requests** — one card per proposal (*"Lena Black asks Jean Hart to take their place"*) with **Approve** and **Reject**. See [Substitutions](./substitutions.md).
4. **Upcoming** — a table of the occurrences in the window: **When** (the volunteers' start time), **Ministry** and team, **Schedule**, **Staffed** (for example *Needs 2 more*, *Covered · 1 more welcome* or *Full*), **Status** and an action menu with **Staff this occurrence**, **Open the ministry** and, unless its event was deleted, **View the event**. The Staffed badge is red when a position is short, amber when every position has its people but someone has not answered, green when everyone has answered, and grey for a date that requires nobody and has nobody yet (*Optional*) or has *No staffing needs set*. Its tooltip gives the numbers, for example *"3 assigned, 3 needed, room for 1 more · 2 not yet confirmed"*. See [How staffing reads](./staffing-an-occurrence.md#how-staffing-reads).
5. **My ministries and teams** — the ministries and teams the viewer manages. For a team leader on a staff login this card is their way in: they lead a team, not the ministry above it, so the ministry name is marked **View only**.
6. **Notifications** — the number of volunteer emails that could not be delivered. An administrator gets a **Ministry Settings** button; anyone else is asked to tell an administrator. See [Volunteer email and reminders](./email-and-reminders.md).

**Show the next 7 / 14 / 28 / 90 days** sets the window (28 by default); **Refresh** re-reads everything. A very long list is capped, with a note to narrow the window.

## Scoped to what you manage

The dashboard shows only the ministries and teams the viewer may manage: an administrator or Manage Ministries user sees the whole church; a coordinator sees their ministries; a team leader sees their team's schedules. Deactivated ministries contribute nothing. See [Who can do what](./permissions.md).

## New ministry

Administrators and Manage Ministries users also have the **New ministry** button here — see [Ministries, teams and positions](./ministries-teams-positions.md). When nothing is set up yet the **My ministries and teams** card says so and offers the same button.
