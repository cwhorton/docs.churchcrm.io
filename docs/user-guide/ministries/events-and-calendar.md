# Events and the calendar

Volunteer Management v2 schedules people for events on the church [calendar](../events.md). It never invents dates of its own: every occurrence a team staffs is tied to a calendar event, and the event's date and time decide when the volunteers serve. So the events come first. A ministry creates its own events on its **Calendar** tab, and a schedule then follows them, or follows church services and class meetings that are already on the calendar.

The order of work is:

1. **Create the events** on the Calendar tab, one-time or recurring (or use events that are already on the church calendar).
2. **Add a schedule** that follows them, with its staffing needs. See [Schedules and occurrences](./schedules-and-occurrences.md).
3. **Fill the positions** on each occurrence. See [Staffing an occurrence](./staffing-an-occurrence.md).

After you create events on the Calendar tab, the page asks whether to staff them now and takes you to the next step.

## The Calendar tab

The **Calendar** tab of the [ministry page](./ministries-teams-positions.md) lists the events this ministry owns, the soonest first. Turn on **Show past events** to see the last year's events instead, the newest first.

![The Calendar tab](/img/user-guide/ministries/ministry-calendar.png)

| Column | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Date and time** | When the event happens, for example *"Oct 4, 9:30 AM – 10:15 AM"*. |
| **Event** | The title, linked to the event's page, with its event type underneath and an *Inactive* badge when the event is inactive. |
| **Calendars** | The calendars the event is on. |
| **Class** | The Sunday School class that is the event's Linked Group, if any. |
| **Staffing** | One badge per team of this ministry that staffs the event, for example *"Faith City: 3 of 3"*: red while a position is short, yellow while someone has not answered, green when every position is filled and confirmed. Each badge opens that occurrence. *Not staffed* when no team staffs it. A past event also shows its headcount, for example *"Headcount: 42"* or *"No headcount recorded yet"*. |

The action menu of a row offers **Staff this event** (for an upcoming, active event: the [Staff an event](#staff-an-event) dialog with the event already chosen), **Edit event**, which opens the church event editor, and **View event**.

To end a series or remove events, tick them (the header box selects every row) and click **Delete events (N)**. The confirmation explains that the events leave every calendar, with their check-ins and headcounts, and that the ministry's occurrences for them keep only their dates. If another ministry has volunteers assigned to one of the events, the confirmation names that ministry, and the delete is refused unless you may manage the church calendar (the **Add Events** permission). The **Delete** on the Occurrences tab, by contrast, removes only the staffing and never the event.

## New event and New recurring event

**New event** and **New recurring event** open the same dialog, with a **One-time** / **Recurring** switch at the top.

![New recurring event](/img/user-guide/ministries/new-recurring-event.png)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Title** | The event's title. A schedule that follows *This ministry's events* matches this title exactly. |
| **Event type** | Starts on the default event type for ministry events (see [The "Other" event type](#the-other-event-type)), and can be changed. Choose a type with attendance count categories for a class that needs a headcount. |
| **Description** | Optional, for example the room. |
| **Class** | Optional. The class becomes the event's Linked Group: its roster is who checks in, and a schedule for the class finds these events. Shown only when the ministry provides teachers for Sunday School. |
| **Date** | One-time only. Starts on tomorrow. |
| **Repeats** | Recurring only: **Weekly** on a **Day of the week**, **Monthly** on a **Day of the month** (*"A day a month does not have falls on its last day."*), or **Yearly** on a **Date each year**. |
| **First date**, **Last date** | Recurring only. **Last date** starts one year after the first date and moves with it until you change it yourself. It is required: if you clear it, it is put back with the note *"A recurring event needs a last date, so it is back to …"*. |
| **Start time**, **End time** | The event's times. They start at 9:00 and 10:00. |
| **Calendars** | The calendars the events go on. The ministry's own calendar is ticked to start with. A coordinator sees only the ministry's own calendar and the church calendars an administrator has opened to the ministry (see [Calendars a ministry may use](#calendars-a-ministry-may-use)). |

For a recurring event the dialog shows what it will make, for example *"Creates 53 events, every Wednesday from Oct 7 to Oct 6, 2027"*. It says so when no date matches, or when the range would make more than 366 events, which is the most one series can have. The scheduling horizon does not limit how far a series reaches.

Click **Create**. The dialog only creates the events; staffing them is the next question.

### Staff them now?

After **Create**, the page asks *"11 Wednesday Bible Study events created. Staff them now?"*, or for a one-time event *"Fall Workday on Oct 17 created. Staff it now?"*

![Staff them now?](/img/user-guide/ministries/staff-them-prompt.png)

- **Not now** closes the question and does nothing else. The events stay on the calendar, and you can staff them later.
- **Staff them** on a **one-time event** opens [Staff an event](#staff-an-event) with the new event already chosen.
- **Staff them** on a **recurring event** looks for the ministry's active schedules that already follow these events: a class schedule on the same class, or a schedule that follows this ministry's events, or church events of the same type, with exactly this title. Every schedule that matches makes occurrences for the new events up to the scheduling horizon, extends its first or last date to cover them when needed, and assigns its default volunteers. The page then opens the **Occurrences** tab, filtered to the title, with a message per schedule, for example *""Wednesday Bible Study": 8 occurrences created"*. When all the new events lie beyond the horizon, the page stays on the Calendar tab and says that the schedules will staff them as they come within the horizon.
- When **no schedule follows** the new events, the Schedules tab opens **Add schedule**, already filled in: *A class's meetings* on the class when the events have one, otherwise *This ministry's events* with exactly this title; the team linked to that class, otherwise the first team; and the title as the schedule's name. Add the staffing needs and default volunteers and click **Save**. See [Adding a schedule](./schedules-and-occurrences.md#adding-a-schedule).

ChurchCRM finds a series by its class or its title, because calendar events do not record which series they belong to. A schedule that follows a title therefore takes every event with that title, whichever series it was created in.

## Staff an event

Some events happen once and need people only that day: a workday, a funeral meal, a baptism. **Staff an event** staffs one such event without a schedule. It is on the **Occurrences** tab, in a Calendar tab row's action menu (**Staff this event**), and after **Staff them** for a one-time event.

![Staff an event](/img/user-guide/ministries/staff-an-event.png)

1. Type part of the title in **Find an event**, or pick a **Date**, to search the upcoming active events. Each event is listed as *"Oct 17, 8:00 AM — Fall Workday (Church Service)"*, with *"· already staffed by this team"* when the chosen team already has an occurrence on it. Any upcoming event can be staffed, including events that another ministry or the church owns.
2. Choose the **Team**, and optionally a **Name** (the event's title is used when it is left empty).
3. Set the **Volunteer times** and the **Staffing needs**, as for a schedule.
4. Click **Staff this event**.

The occurrence appears on the Occurrences tab with a **single event** badge. Deleting it there removes everything Staff an event made. A team can staff an event only once this way, but it may also staff the same event from a regular schedule, for example setup through a schedule and cleanup as a single event. The scheduling horizon does not apply: an event months away can be staffed today.

## The "Other" event type

ChurchCRM 7.8.0 adds an event type named **Other** when the installation has none. A ministry's new events start with the type chosen in **Admin → Ministry Settings → Default event type for ministry events**. When that setting is not set, or names a type that was deleted or deactivated, the type named "Other" is used. The type can still be changed for each event.

## Calendars a ministry may use

Every ministry is created with a calendar of its own, listed under **Ministry Calendars** in the Calendar page's calendar picker. Its coordinators may put the ministry's events on it.

An administrator, or anyone with the **Add Events** permission, can also open a church calendar to ministries. On the Calendar page, open a church calendar's settings (or **New Calendar**) and choose **Ministries that may add events**. *"Their coordinators may pin their ministry's events to this calendar without Add Events permission."* For example, a shared *Bible Classes* calendar opened to the Children's and Adult Ministries holds every class meeting. A ministry's own calendar has no such field.

## Events, classes and headcounts

A class meets at events: one event per class per meeting, with the class as its Linked Group. Check-in, the kiosk and the class roster all work from that event, as they do in core ChurchCRM. A schedule that follows *A class's meetings* staffs exactly those events.

The [occurrence page](./staffing-an-occurrence.md#headcount) shows the event's **Headcount**: the event type's attendance count categories and their total, entered in the event editor. Volunteer Management never writes check-ins or counts itself.

## The Volunteer Ministry field on an event

In the church event editor (and in the calendar's side-panel editor), under **Show more options**, a **Volunteer Ministry** dropdown sits directly beneath **Linked Group**: *"Lets that ministry's coordinators schedule volunteers for this event — and edit the event itself."* It lists the ministries the editor may manage, with **No ministry** first. Events created on a ministry's Calendar tab already have it set.

## The Volunteers card on the event view

An event with volunteer occurrences shows a **Volunteers** card on its detail page: the ministry, the schedule, *"N of M filled"* and a badge (*"N still needed"*, **Fully staffed**, or **No staffing needs set**), with a **Manage staffing** link to the [staffing view](./staffing-an-occurrence.md). An event that no team staffs shows no card.

## Coordinators and events

Normally only users with **Add Events** may create and edit events. A ministry coordinator (or a Manage Ministries user) without that permission may still create, edit, re-time, deactivate and delete the events **of their own ministry**: on the ministry's Calendar tab, and in the church event editor, where the **Add Church Event** entry appears for them, the Volunteer Ministry field lists only their ministries and must be set. Any other event is refused. Team leaders cannot create events.

## Deleting an event

Deleting a calendar event does not delete the occurrences that followed it. Each occurrence keeps its date, its people and its history, but no longer has times, and the *"Times come from this event"* link disappears.
