# Volunteers: the pool and qualifications

Two separate statements are made about every volunteer:

- **They are in the pool** — they volunteer for this ministry. Every ministry has a pool **Group**, created with it, and the pool is simply that Group's membership.
- **They are qualified for a position** — they can be assigned to it, sign up for it, or stand in for someone on it. A tick in the qualification grid says so.

Being in the pool is candidacy; a tick is eligibility. The **Volunteers** tab of the [ministry page](./ministries-teams-positions.md) is where both are managed.

## The pool Group

The Group is a real [Group](../groups.md), listed under **Groups** by the ministry's name, and its membership can be edited there like any other group. Its identity, though, belongs to the ministry: the group page says so and its Edit and Delete buttons are disabled, because the ministry owns it. Deleting the ministry deletes the Group.

People arrive in the pool in several ways:

- **Add Volunteer** on the Volunteers tab — the standard person search, then **Add**.
- **Add from Cart** — everyone in the [Cart](../cart.md) joins in one step (*"Everyone in the cart joins this ministry's volunteers. Tick their positions afterwards."*).
- Being made a **coordinator** of the ministry or a **leader** of one of its teams.
- Offering to help from the Member Portal's Open Opportunities page.
- Being added to the Group under **Groups**.

Neither dialog grants a qualification; the new person appears in the grid with no ticks, which is the prompt for the second step.

## The qualification grid

The grid shows people down the side and the selected team's positions across the top, with a checkbox in each cell. Choose the **Team** to see its positions; the grid starts on the first team. When the list has more than five names a **Find a volunteer** box appears; type part of a name to filter.

- **Ticks save as you make them.** There is no Save button: each tick is its own write and confirms itself in the standard notification (*"Barista: Constance Hart qualified"*). If a save fails the box rolls back.
- Untick to take a qualification away. The history of what that person served is kept.
- Only **active** positions have a column. Deactivating a position hides its column; reactivating it brings the ticks back.

The rows are the pool **plus** anyone qualified for a position in view who is not in the pool — those rows carry a **Not in the pool** hint. Qualifying someone outside the pool is allowed; they are offered in the staffing picker under *"Not in the pool"*.

For a team [linked to a Sunday School class](./ministries-teams-positions.md#linking-a-team-to-a-sunday-school-class), a tick also makes the person a **Teacher** of the class, and taking away their last tick in that team removes the Teacher role.

:::tip A position nobody is qualified for cannot be staffed
Before creating a schedule, make sure every position it needs has at least one tick. The staffing picker and the **Default volunteer** lists only ever offer qualified people, and the **Generate occurrences** dialog says *"Nobody is qualified for this position yet, so it stays open."*
:::

## Removing a volunteer

The **Actions** menu at the end of a row offers **Remove Volunteer** (ministry coordinators and above). It takes away every qualification the person holds in this ministry, cancels their assignments on upcoming occurrences, clears them as the [default volunteer](./schedules-and-occurrences.md#staffing-needs-and-default-volunteers) on every schedule of the ministry, and removes them from the pool Group. Past service history stays. The notification reports what was removed, for example *"Removed. 2 qualifications, 3 upcoming assignments, 2 schedule defaults."*

Taking away a single qualification is different: the person stays a schedule's default volunteer, and that position is left open on new occurrences until they are qualified again.

## Where else qualifications show up

- A person's record has a **Volunteer** tab listing what they are **Qualified for** and when they are **Serving next** — see [Persons](../persons.md#volunteer-tab).
- The row menu of a position has **Add Volunteers to Cart**, which puts everyone qualified for it into the Cart.
