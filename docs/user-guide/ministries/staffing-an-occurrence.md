# Staffing an occurrence

The staffing view answers *who is needed, who is on, and what is still short* for a single date. Reach it from the **Fill** button on the [Ministry Dashboard](./ministry-dashboard.md), from the date link on the ministry's **Occurrences** tab, from a staffing badge on its **Calendar** tab, from the **Manage staffing** link on an event, or by URL at `/ministries/occurrences/{id}`.

**Back to Occurrences** at the top returns to the ministry's Occurrences tab with the team, event and date filters you came from.

## The header

The schedule name, when the volunteers serve (for example *"Oct 4, 9:15 AM – 10:15 AM"*), the ministry and team, and a **Scheduled** or **Cancelled** badge. On the right, the header links to the calendar event the occurrence follows, says *"Times come from this event"*, and gives the event's location when it has one. When the schedule moves the volunteers' times away from the event's, a sentence says how, for example *"Volunteers start 15 minutes before the event starts."* Change the event's time in the calendar and the occurrence follows.

Dates and times on this page, and everywhere in Volunteer Management, follow ChurchCRM's language setting ([Localization & Formats](../../administration/localization.md), or the user's own language), for example *"Oct 4, 9:15 AM"* in English. They are always the church's local time, and the year is shown only for a date in another year.

## One card per position

Each card says in its header how the position stands, for example **Needs 2 more** or **Covered · 1 more welcome**, with the numbers on the line below (*"2 assigned, 2 needed, room for 1 more"*). Then come the people assigned, each with a status badge and a row menu. A position with nobody on it shows *Nobody assigned yet*.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Assigned and asked to respond. Counts as filled. |
| **Accepted** | They said yes. |
| **Declined** | They said no; the slot is open again. |
| **Cancelled** | The coordinator took them off. The row stays, because it has history. |
| **Substituted** | Someone else took their place — see [Substitutions](./substitutions.md). |
| **Completed** | The occurrence has passed. |

### How staffing reads

A count is always a status word first and the numbers second. Min decides the colour and Max decides how much room is left.

| Label | When | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| **Needs 2 more** | Fewer people than Min. The numbers read *"0 of 2–3"* (nobody yet, 2 to 3 wanted) or *"0 of 1"* when Min and Max are the same. | Red |
| **Covered · 1 more welcome** | Min is met and Max leaves room for more, for example *"2 assigned, 2 needed, room for 1 more"*. | Green, or yellow while someone has not answered (*"· 2 not yet confirmed"*) |
| **Optional · up to 2 welcome** | Min is 0 and nobody is on it yet. | Grey |
| **Optional · 1 of up to 2** | Min is 0 and someone is on it. | Green, or yellow while someone has not answered |
| **Full · 3 of 3** | Max is reached. | Green, or yellow while someone has not answered |
| **Not needed this time** | This occurrence's own needs set the position to Min 0 and Max 0. | Grey |

A whole date (every position of the occurrence together, or one team on an event) reads the same way, added up: **Needs N more** with the total shortfall when any position is short, otherwise **Full** when no position has room, **Optional** when nothing is required, and **Covered · N more welcome** in every other case. The same words are used everywhere Volunteer Management shows a count: the [Ministry Dashboard](./ministry-dashboard.md), the tooltips on the Occurrences tab, the badges on the Calendar tab, the Volunteers card on an event and the member portal's volunteer pages.

### Assign a volunteer

Click **Assign** on a card. The **Assign a volunteer** dialog lists only people qualified for that position, *"whoever served least recently is listed first"* — that ordering is the rotation, with nothing to configure. People **In the volunteer pool** come first; anyone qualified but **Not in the pool** is listed under its own heading, with a note that assigning them adds them to this occurrence only.

Choosing someone who already holds another position on this occurrence shows a caution — *"… is already serving as Barista on this occurrence. You can still assign them."* — and nothing more: two positions in one service is a supported arrangement, and the warning exists so it is never an accident.

Click **Assign**. The card updates, the person is emailed (once background jobs run — see [Volunteer email and reminders](./email-and-reminders.md)), and their row shows **Pending** until they answer.

### Row menu

- **Record: they accepted** / **Record: they declined** — for a reply that came by phone or in the corridor. The confirmation says the response *"is saved as coming from you, not from them"*, and that is how it is kept in the history.
- **Send the assignment message again** — re-queues the assignment email.
- **Cancel assignment** — takes the person off; they are told and the slot reopens. The row stays visible.
- **View person** — opens their record.

## Edit staffing needs

**Edit staffing needs** in the card header changes how many of each position *this occurrence* needs — *"this week we need four"*. The dialog shows the same Min/Max rows as the schedule with the note *"These needs come from the schedule. Saving here changes this occurrence only."* Once saved, the occurrence *"has its own staffing needs, set apart from its schedule"*; **Use the schedule's needs** drops them and the occurrence follows its schedule again.

An occurrence whose schedule has no staffing needs shows *No staffing needs set* with a **Set staffing needs** button instead of position cards.

## Headcount

Below the staffing, the **Headcount** card shows the event's attendance counts: each count category of the event's type with its number, and the **Total**, or *"No headcount recorded yet"*. Counts are entered in the church event editor, which **Enter counts** opens for anyone who may edit the event. When the event has a class as its Linked Group, the card also says how many of the class have checked in, for example *"Checked in: 6 of 8 on the class roster"*. The card is read-only: Volunteer Management never records counts or check-ins itself.

## Assigned outside the current plan

If a position is removed from the staffing plan after people were assigned to it, they are listed in a separate **Assigned outside the current plan** card so they are not lost. Cancel them or add the position back.

## Substitution requests

The **Substitution requests** card at the bottom lists proposals from volunteers on this occurrence, with **Approve** and **Reject** in the row menu. How that works is on [Substitutions](./substitutions.md).

## When a date will not happen

To remove a date, tick it on the ministry's **Occurrences** tab and click **Delete**: the occurrence goes with its assignments, responses and queued reminders, and the calendar event stays. To call off the event itself, delete it on the ministry's Calendar tab, or deactivate or delete it in the event editor (see [Deleting an event](./events-and-calendar.md#deleting-an-event)).

An occurrence whose status is **Cancelled** keeps its history and its **Assign** buttons are disabled.
