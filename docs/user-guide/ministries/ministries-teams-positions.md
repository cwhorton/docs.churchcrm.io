# Ministries, teams and positions

A **ministry** is the unit everything else hangs off: it owns its teams, positions, volunteer pool, schedules, its events and a calendar of its own. Every **position** belongs to a **team**, and every ministry has at least one team.

:::note Not the same as a Group of type "Ministry"
A [Group](../groups.md) whose type is "Ministry" is just a group. A v2 ministry is created under **Ministries**, uses positions rather than group roles, and gets a pool Group of its own automatically. See [Volunteers: the pool and qualifications](./volunteers-and-qualifications.md).
:::

## Creating a ministry

Only an administrator or a user with **Manage Ministries** can create one (see [Who can do what](./permissions.md)).

1. Go to **Ministries → Dashboard**.
2. Click **New ministry**. The dialog explains: *"A ministry is created with its own calendar, volunteer pool and first team, so the only things to decide here are its name and what it does."*
3. Enter the **Ministry name** and a **Description**.
4. Turn on **Can this ministry provide teachers for Sunday School?** only for a ministry whose teams teach Sunday School classes, such as a children's ministry (see [Editing a ministry](#editing-a-ministry)). It is off by default.
5. Click **Create ministry**.

You land on the new ministry's page. Its first team (named after the ministry) and its pool Group already exist, and the ministry now has an entry under **Ministries** in the sidebar.

## The ministry page

**Ministries → *the ministry's name***, or `/ministries/{id}`. The header shows the name, an **Inactive** badge when the ministry is deactivated, an **Edit** button (see [Editing a ministry](#editing-a-ministry)) and the lifecycle buttons described [below](#deactivating-reactivating-and-deleting). Seven tabs follow:

| Tab | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Three counts (**Teams**, **Volunteers**, **Unfilled Positions**), the description, the **Teams** card and — for ministry managers — the **Ministry Coordinators** card. |
| **Positions** | The roles people serve in. |
| **Volunteers** | The pool and the qualification grid — see [Volunteers: the pool and qualifications](./volunteers-and-qualifications.md). |
| **Schedules** | Which calendar events each team staffs, with how many people — see [Schedules and occurrences](./schedules-and-occurrences.md). |
| **Occurrences** | The dates those schedules produced, each with a **Filled** indicator, and **Staff an event** for a single event. |
| **Calendar** | The events this ministry owns, with **New event** and **New recurring event** — see [Events and the calendar](./events-and-calendar.md). |
| **Help Wanted** | A switch that puts the ministry on the Member Portal's Open Opportunities page, and the text shown there. |

![The ministry page, Overview tab](/img/user-guide/ministries/ministry-overview.png)

**Unfilled Positions** counts the open slots across every future occurrence of the ministry, so it is the quickest way to see whether the ministry is short of people.

## Editing a ministry

**Edit** in the header opens **Edit ministry**: the **Ministry name**, the **Description** and **Can this ministry provide teachers for Sunday School?**

![Edit ministry](/img/user-guide/ministries/edit-ministry.png)

Turn the switch on for a ministry whose teams teach Sunday School classes: *"Its teams can then be linked to a class, and its schedules and events can use one."* While it is off, the ministry's screens hide everything about classes: the **Sunday School Class** field in the team dialog, the **A class's meetings** choice in the schedule dialog (except on a schedule that already follows a class) and the **Class** field for new events.

Only an administrator or a Manage Ministries user can change the switch. A coordinator sees it greyed out, with *"Only a volunteer manager can change this."* It cannot be turned off while one of the ministry's teams is linked to a class; unlink the class first.

### Help Wanted

The **Help Wanted** tab puts this ministry on the Member Portal **Open Opportunities** page, where any volunteer can see it and offer to help — they join the volunteer pool and you are emailed. Turn on **Show this ministry on the Open Opportunities page**, write what you want to say (line breaks are kept), and click **Save**.

A ministry also appears on that page when any of its active positions is marked **Recruit Volunteers** (see [Positions](#positions)), so you do not have to use this tab to advertise a specific role.

## Teams

Teams live in the **Teams** card on the **Overview** tab. Each row shows the name (with its Sunday School class underneath when it has one), description, **Team Leader**, the number of positions and an Active/Inactive status.

- **Add team** opens the team dialog: **Team name**, **Description**, **Team leader**, **Sunday School Class** (when the ministry provides teachers for Sunday School) and an **Active** switch.
- The row menu offers **Edit** and **Delete**. **Delete** removes the team and everything in it — its positions, qualifications, staffing needs, schedules, occurrences and assignments, past service records included — and its team-leader grant. The confirmation says so. A ministry's last team cannot be deleted; rename it instead.
- Turning a team's **Active** switch off keeps it, greyed, with its history.

The **Team leader** field is where a team leader is granted. Only a ministry manager sees the picker; a coordinator sees the current leader as read-only text with *"Only a volunteer manager can change the team leader"*. Clearing the field removes the leader. What a team leader can do is on [Who can do what](./permissions.md).

### Linking a team to a Sunday School class

A team that teaches a Sunday School class can be linked to it in the team dialog's **Sunday School Class** field. The class's teachers are then managed here, in the ministry, and not on the class page.

![A team linked to a Sunday School class](/img/user-guide/ministries/team-sunday-school-class.png)

- **Everyone qualified for a position of this team becomes a teacher of the class.** Ticking a qualification on the [Volunteers tab](./volunteers-and-qualifications.md) gives the person the class's **Teacher** role; taking away their last qualification in the team removes it. Someone who is a **Student** of the class cannot be qualified.
- **The class's current teachers are brought in.** When you choose a class that already has teachers, the dialog asks which position to **Qualify its current teachers for**, and says how many there are (*"Teachers to import: 2"*). A team with no position named Teacher can create one here (*"New position: Teacher"*).
- **The class page stops changing teachers.** The Sunday School class page and the group page say *"Teachers of this class are managed in Ministries → Children's Ministry → Faith City."* with a link, and refuse teacher changes. Students are still managed there as before. Attendance, the Sunday School dashboard and the class reports keep reading the Teacher role as before.
- **A new schedule for the team** starts on *A class's meetings* with this class. See [Adding a schedule](./schedules-and-occurrences.md#adding-a-schedule).
- **Clearing the field** unlinks the class and leaves its members as they are.

The link and the class's events are separate things. When **Edit team** changes or clears the class and this ministry created events for the old class, the dialog says how many (*"Children's Ministry created 52 events for Class 1-3 (52 upcoming)."*) and asks what should happen to them: **Keep them on Class 1-3** (the default), **Remove the class from them**, or **Move them to** the new class. **Delete** on a linked team asks the same, with **Delete those events** instead of moving them, and names any other ministry that staffs some of them. Only events this ministry created are changed; events an administrator created are never touched.

## Positions

A position is a role someone serves in — Espresso, Song Leader, Lead Teacher. The **Positions** tab lists them with **Order**, **Name**, **Description**, **Team**, **Recruiting**, **Self sign-up**, **Status** and an action menu.

![The Positions tab](/img/user-guide/ministries/ministry-positions.png)

**Add position** (and **Edit** in a row's menu) opens a dialog with:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Position name**, **Description** | The description is shown to volunteers on the Member Portal when the position is recruiting. |
| **Team** | Every position belongs to one team. |
| **Order** | Sort order on this tab and in staffing views. |
| **Active** | An inactive position is kept with its history but can no longer be staffed or advertised. Deactivate here rather than deleting a position that has been used. |
| **Recruit Volunteers** | *"Advertise this position on the Member Portal Open Opportunities page."* Off by default. |
| **Self-assignable** | On by default: qualified volunteers may sign themselves up for open dates of this position. Turn it off for positions only a team leader or coordinator should assign (the preacher is chosen, not signed up for); the Member Portal will not offer them. |

The row menu also offers:

- **Add Volunteers to Cart** — puts everyone qualified for the position into the [Cart](../cart.md), ready to email or export.
- **Delete** — removes the position with its qualifications, staffing needs and assignments, past service records included. To keep the history, deactivate the position instead.

A position nobody is qualified for cannot be staffed; the next step is the [Volunteers tab](./volunteers-and-qualifications.md).

## Ministry Coordinators

The **Ministry Coordinators** card on the Overview tab is shown to administrators and Manage Ministries users only. **Add coordinator** grants a person authority over this whole ministry — its teams, positions, schedules and every assignment in it. **Remove** takes it back.

Authority is given to the person, not to a login, so it can be granted before they have one. To actually open the ministry page, the coordinator's login also needs the **Manage My Ministries** permission — see [Who can do what](./permissions.md).

## Deactivating, reactivating and deleting

- **Deactivate** (on an active ministry) is offered to anyone who can open the page, including a coordinator on their own ministry. Nothing is removed: the ministry moves from the **Ministries** heading to the nested **Deactivated Ministries** group, its page shows an **Inactive** badge, and it contributes nothing to the [Ministry Dashboard](./ministry-dashboard.md).
- **Reactivate** (on a deactivated ministry) puts it back.
- **Delete** is shown on a deactivated ministry to administrators and Manage Ministries users only. The confirmation quotes how many occurrences and assignments will go with it, past service records included. Deleting removes the ministry's teams, positions, qualifications, schedules, occurrences, assignments, its pool Group and its calendar.

:::warning Delete is permanent
An active ministry cannot be deleted — deactivate it first, which is also the moment to change your mind. Once deleted, the ministry's service history is gone.
