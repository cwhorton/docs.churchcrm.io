# Security

> ChurchCRM should only run over HTTPS connections.

## User Accounts

Any person record in ChurchCRM can be promoted to a user account. By default, a person is not permitted to log in until an administrator provisions them with a user account.

## Role-Based Access Control

ChurchCRM uses roles to control access to sensitive data. The available roles are:

- Add Records
- Edit Records
- Delete Records
- Manage Properties and Classifications
- Manage Groups and Roles
- Manage Donations and Finance
- View, Add, and Edit Notes
- Edit Self
- Admin

## Permissions Matrix

| Permission | Add Records | Edit Records | Delete Records | Manage Props | Manage Groups | Finance | Notes | Edit Self | Admin |

| View people & families | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| Add/edit/view notes | | | | | | | ✓ | | ✓ |

*Edit Self allows a user to update their own person record only.

## Granular Permissions (Permission Group Level)

The following permissions are controlled at the **permission group level** (Admin → Permission Groups), not on a per-user basis:

- Email via mailto links
- Mailto delimiter
- US address verification
- Add event

> **Note:** Directory listing and CSV export are available to all authenticated users and do not require a per-user or per-group permission flag.

## Media Privacy

### Member Photo Folder Protection

Member and family photo directories are protected from unauthenticated access. Web requests to photo folder paths without a valid logged-in ChurchCRM session are blocked (HTTP 403).

This applies to:
- Member/person photo uploads
- Family photo uploads

**What this means in practice:**
- Member photos can no longer be accessed by guessing or scraping directory URLs without being logged in.
- Any external integrations or kiosk displays that embedded direct photo URLs (without a valid ChurchCRM session) will need to be updated to authenticate first.
- The ChurchCRM directory listing feature is unaffected — it continues to display photos to logged-in users normally.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Users can self-enroll 2FA from **My Settings → Security**. Admins can reset 2FA for any user from the Users panel.

Supported method: **TOTP** (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, and any RFC 6238 app). Recovery codes are generated at enrollment — advise users to store them safely.

### Requiring 2FA

Administrators can require users to enroll in 2FA. The **2FA Grace Period Days** setting controls how long a user has to complete enrollment after mandatory 2FA takes effect. The default is **7 days**; set the grace period to **0** for immediate enforcement.

During the grace period, users can continue signing in and see a warning reminding them to enroll. The warning becomes more urgent when one day or less remains. Once the grace period expires, the user must complete 2FA enrollment before continuing to use ChurchCRM.

If a user disables their own 2FA while mandatory 2FA is active, a new grace window begins for that user. Disabling the system-wide mandate does not erase the stored grace-start timestamp.
